Developed at the 2016 Capital One Summit for Software Engineers Hackathon.

Connect to your credit card account of your choice, and weâ€™ll do the analysis for you. Visualize your money in terms of the products you purchase most often, and set goals for yourself to save money towards the big wins in life - like buying a car or paying for a wedding.

We round up every transaction you make and invest the spare change into your own Carrot savings account. All of your information is stored with your Capital One account, and you have the flexibility to save and withdraw more money at any time.
